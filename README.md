# Resume 2024

## Description

Welcome to my Github! Here is my 2024 version of my online portfolio. As I am currently looking for a position to excel with my skill as a graphic designer, computer programmer, and artist, I felt that it would be a great challenge to create my own portfolio webpage as a resource for job posters. 


I built this page using React as a single page application. Feel free to check out my portfolio!
